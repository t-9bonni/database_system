# database_system
This project was written in the coding language SQL in the platform MySQL Workbench. We were given a case description and an entity relationship diagram (ERD) for a vacation planning company and expected to create a database from scratch and test it against several scripts. 

To test our database, we were given several report query scripts and database maintenance scripts to test. We included a restore scripts to be run initially. The files must be run in the order for which they are listed.
